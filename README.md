# KappaDeep
KappaDeep is an asynchronous Twitch bot framework built in Python 3.

## Installation
Clone this repo.

## Requirements
Create a Twitch account for your bot [here](https://www.twitch.tv).

## Configuration
All bot configurations are done in a config.py file. Create config.py and add the following:

```python
DESCRIPTION = 'KappaDeep bot.'
TWITCH_TOKEN = 'oauth:abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
STREAMLABS_TOKEN = ''
HOST = 'irc.chat.twitch.tv'
PORT = 6667
NICK = 'bot_twitch_username'
CHANNEL = 'twitch_channel'
```
1. Replace `NICK` with the Twitch account name of your bot.
2. Replace `CHANNEL` with the Twitch username of the channel that your bot will operate on. This is typically your username.
3. Replace `TWITCH_TOKEN` with an oauth token generated by visiting [here](https://twitchapps.com/tmi/). Be sure to use the bot's Twitch account.
